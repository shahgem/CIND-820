## **Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices Using Machine Learning Algorithms**

With the advancement and modernization of technology, various industries are rapidly evolving to adapt to the latest global trends. One such change that has been taking place is the increasing prevalence of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange and investment. This shift towards digital currencies represents a significant departure from traditional fiat currencies and stock exchange practices and It’s the time to understand what digital money really means for everyone’s future.

### **Overview of the Data**

The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from Kaggle Inc, and is publicly accessible under the title "Cryptocurrency Market Data Historical Cryptocurrency Price for All tokens!". 
During this course of study, I will emphasis on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Binance Coin (BNB). Although Kaggle provides separate CSV files for each cryptocurrency, the author of this project has amalgamated all the individual files into a single CSV file named "crypto_market.csv". This amalgamation was possible due to the identical columns of each file, i.e., Serial Number, Name, Symbol, Date, High, Low, Open, Close, Volume, Market Capitalization.
The initial dataset brings to the fore the non-uniformity of the trading dates of the various currencies. As previously noted, BTC has been in circulation for the longest period, pre-dating all the other cryptocurrencies in the dataset. Since the start dates for each currency, which may significantly impact their predicted prices. To mitigate this potential bias, it is advisable to limit the analysis to the period from 2017 onwards, as this provides a more consistent and recent historical data for all the selected currencies. This filtered dataset has been saved under the file name "sixcryto.csv".
In light of this, during the analysis phase of this project, it is prudent to compare all currencies from 2017 onwards, so as to minimize prediction bias and incorporate a more uniform and recent historical data.

### **Problem Statement**:

What are the most effective predictive and time series analysis techniques for forecasting short-term closing prices of cryptocurrencies? Which features are influential predictors for classifying the short-term closing prices of selected cryptocurrencies?

What is the correlation between the predicted prices generated by machine learning algorithms and the actual prices of the chosen cryptocurrencies?
